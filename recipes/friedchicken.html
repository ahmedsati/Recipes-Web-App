        <li>2 cups cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tbsp salt</li>

        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>

        <li>1 cup water, cold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Here is how we can make Fried Chicken:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Pierce chicken carefully with a knife and brine with whole milk (or water), salt, garlic, black peppercorns, and bay leaves. Brine for 2-3 hours or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, kosher salt, white pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and baking powder and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Take 1 cup of your seasoning mix and combine in a separate bowl with cold water and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the brine and spoon a few tablespoons of brine into the seasoning mix and rub together with your hands to create small clumps. These craggily bits will add extra texture to the chicken.</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of chicken in the wet batter and let any excess drip off. Immediately dredge in seasoning mix and press the mix into the chicken until completely coated. Let rest on a baking sheet while you heat up your oil.</li>
        <li>In a large cast iron pan, dutch oven, or heavy bottomed pan/wok, fry chicken at 350F for 8-12 minutes (depending on size of the chicken) until the internal temperature reads 165F.</li>
    </ol>
